pbox2d-builder is a simplified framework for experimenting with the box2d physics engine in Processing. Typcially using PBox2D you will have to create a wrapper class for each object you create. This library automates that process and provides access to commonly used functions when setting up your objects.

pbox2d-builder augments the work by Daniel Shifman in PBox2D. All JBox2D and PBox2D functionality is preserved.


From the original PBox2D by Daniel Shiffman below:

A collection of basic examples and/or Processing library to make using JBox2D (http://www.jbox2d.org/) easier for the beginner.

(The tutorial below is out of date as the library now works with JBox2D 2.1.2. Stay tuned.)
